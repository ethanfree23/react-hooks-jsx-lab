What is JSX:
lets us write html-like code in our JS files.

Imperative vs Declarative Programming:
imperative (vanilla js) - describes how something is done in detail
Declarative - describes what you would like to do

JSX is not a string - we are not interpolating HTML strings
JSX is the return value of a function component
JSX works with expressions, not statements
^ if statements do not work, but ternary statements do work
A component can dender another component using jsx
^ use a capital letter: ie. <Header />
A component must return one jsx element
JSX property names: use className instead of class, and use htmlFor instead of for
